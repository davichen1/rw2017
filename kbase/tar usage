No.

Unlike zip, gzip functions as a compression algorithm only.

Because of various reasons some of which hearken back to the era of tape drives, Unix uses a program named tar to archive data, which can then be compressed with a compression program like gzip, bzip2, 7zip, etc.

In order to "zip" a directory, the correct command would be

tar -zcvf archive.tar.gz directory/ 
This will tell tar to c (create) an archive from the files in directory (tar is recursive by default), compress it using the z (gzip) algorithm, store the output as a f (file) named archive.tar.gz, and v (verbosely) list (on /dev/stderr so it doesn't affect piped commands) all the files it adds to the archive.

The tar command offers gzip support (via the -z flag) purely for your convenience. The gzip command/lib is completely separate. The command above is effectively the same as

tar -cv directory | gzip > archive.tar.gz
To decompress and unpack the archive into the current directory you would use

tar -zxvf archive.tar.gz
That command is effectively the same as

gunzip < archive.tar.gz | tar -xv
tar has many, many, MANY other options and uses as well; I heartily recommend reading through its manpage sometime.
